TEST CASE HELMI TAUFIQ ALHAKIM
==============================
This Test Case Project is about to create Timeline and Carousel Component using Swift by myself.
To create a Timeline I use a TableView, where I separate into sections and rows. Sections for headings or Titles and rows for items.
To create a Carousel I use a CollectionView with a horizontal scroll orientation and I set the timer for 3 seconds to automatically shift the Carousel items and of course it can be shifted manually.

Herewith I attach a screenshot of the application and the demo video:
